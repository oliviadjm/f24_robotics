How to launch:
The default launch value is set to maze.wbt. No extra flags are needed. After setting up a Webots port connection on the host machine (differs depending on Mac/Windows), in an Ubuntu terminal run:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch final_project launch_final.py

OR, to run maze1_smallest.wbt, in an Ubuntu terminal run:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch final_project launch_final.py world:=maze1_smallest.wbt


This will run both the controller and the world.
